Project name : ANIMATED BUG WORLD IN GUI
Author -> Biyas Banerjee

ANIMATED BUG WORLD is a GUI based application build on JavaFX. Different types of library have used for 
designing and animation purposes.
 
 --> World contains different types of bugs
 --> Small and Big plants
 --> Stones as obstacle
 --> Bugs can move randomly in world
 --> World has a fixed height and width
 
 
   Main Features of the this project is--> 
  ============================================ 
     -> Usage of JavaFX
     -> Concept of Interface, Class and object
     -> Super and sub class
     -> Implementation of inheritance
     -> object type casting
     -> Java Encapsulation
     -> Usage Scene, Pane and stage
     -> Implementation of VBox and Groups
     -> Implementation of exception handling
     -> Implementation of Time line and KeyFrame.
     -> Implementation of of CSS with JavaFX

 =====================================================================
 As my designing purpose
 
 At the top of the class structure  I have an Interface named--> BugWorldObject
 BugWorldObject have the common methods that implemented in Bug and Plant class
	
 --> I have created a Array list of all BugWorldObject 
 --> MainBugWorldUI is the Entry point of my program
 	
 The following classes have implemented the BugWorldObject
 1) Bug
 2) Plant
 3) Stone
 
 1) Bug--> is the super class of
 				a)  Ant
 				b)  Bee
 				c)  Ladybug
 				d)  Butterfly
	
 2)  PLANT --> is the super class of 
					a) Tree
					b) Grass
					
 3) Stone  -->   implemented the BugWorldObject
   
  Main method --> MainBugWorldUI
 ------------------------------------------------------	
		-->  This program designed using JavaFX
	 	-->  I have used different button using action listener for different methods
	 	-->  Main method used for adding all the creatures
	 	-->  User can add Plants, Bugs and Stones using buttons
	 	-->  Bugs can move different direction randomly
	 	-->  Bugs can not goes outside the Scene
	 	-->  PressnHold button has implemented to move the bugs and stop the bugs
	 	-->  Text animation applied
